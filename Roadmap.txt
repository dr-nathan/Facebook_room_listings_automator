match streets in text: 3 approaches
1. manually search for keywords in text. Problem: when searching 'oude waal', you will search first for 'oude', then 'waal', neither of which match with 'oude waal'
2. use rule based SpaCy scheme: Similar as above, but can probably match streets better. 
3. Use some training method to develop a NER system

TODO: 

isue at the moment:
streets such as j.j. cremerstraat. Remove dots? (as long as remove dots in text as well, could work). But, comparison is done on a word 2 word basis. 
So, j will be no match to j j cremerstraat, the second j neither and cremerstraat neither. 
Can spacy help with this? You define J J Cremerstraat as an entity and SpaCy takes care of the matching
